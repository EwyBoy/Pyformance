# Pyformance
## A simple python course for intermediate programmers about performance and optimization of python code ðŸ’¨âš¡

### What is Pyformance?
Pyformance is a simple python course for intermediate programmers about performance and optimization of python code. It is a collection of simple python scripts that are used to demonstrate the performance of python code. The scripts are written in a way that they are easy to understand and can be used as a reference for writing optimized python code.

### Why Pyformance?
Python is a very powerful language and is used in a lot of places. But it is also a very slow language. It is not as fast as C or C++ and it is not as fast as Java. So, if you are writing a python script that is going to be used in a place where speed is important, then you should definitely optimize your code. This course will help you to do that.

### About the course
This course is divided into 3 parts. The first part is about the basics of python. It will teach you about the basic syntax of python and how to write a simple python script. The second part is about the performance of python. It will teach you about the performance of python and how to optimize your code. The third part is about the optimization of python. It will teach you about the optimization of python and how to optimize your code.
